go-eventsource is a package for building an Event Store

The package is under development and the interfaces may change.

# How to use it

To create a new repository:
`NewRepository(store, serializer)`

It has an interface for saving events and loading an aggregate.

```
type Repository interface {
	// Save one or more events to the repository
	Save(ctx context.Context, events ...Event) error

	// Save one or more events to the repository, within a transaction
	SaveTransaction(ctx context.Context, events ...Event) (StoreTransaction, error)

	// Load events from repository for the given aggregate ID. For each event e,
	// call aggr.On(e) to update the state of aggr. When done, aggr has been
	// "fast forwarded" to the current state.
	Load(ctx context.Context, id string, aggr Aggregate) (deleted bool, err error)

	// Get all events with sequence ID newer than the given ID (see https://github.com/oklog/ulid)
	// Return at most limit records. If limit is 0, don't limit the number of records returned.
	GetEventsBySequenceID(ctx context.Context, sequenceID string, limit int) (events []Event, err error)

	// Same as GetEventsBySequenceID, but only returns events of the same type
	// as the one provided in the eventType parameter.
	GetEventsBySequenceIDAndType(ctx context.Context, sequenceID string, eventType Event, limit int) (events []Event, err error)

	// Get all events newer than the given timestamp
	// Return at most limit records. If limit is 0, don't limit the number of records returned.
	GetEventsByTimestamp(ctx context.Context, timestamp int64, limit int) (events []Event, err error)
}
```

The package comes with one serializer and two stores:

Included serializer:

- `json`

Included stores:

- `dynamodb`
- `memory`
- `sql`

If you want to add your own store or serializer, the package has these defined interfaces.

```
type Store interface {
	NewTransaction(ctx context.Context, records ...Record) (StoreTransaction, error)
	LoadByAggregate(ctx context.Context, aggregateID string) (record []Record, err error)
	LoadBySequenceID(ctx context.Context, sequenceID string, limit int) (record []Record, err error)
	LoadBySequenceIDAndType(ctx context.Context, sequenceID string, eventType string, limit int) (records []Record, err error)
	LoadByTimestamp(ctx context.Context, timestamp int64, limit int) (record []Record, err error)
}

type StoreTransaction interface {
	Commit() error
	Rollback() error
}
```

```
type Serializer interface {
	Unmarshal(data []byte, eventType string) (Event, error)
	Marshal(event Event) ([]byte, error)
}
```

### UUID Compatibility
You might have to enable compatibility with our internal UUID package using an after-connect handler
